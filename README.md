# PowerBi Project
>
**Hi everyone,**<br>
Recently I have done one project on power bi and SQL. Analyzed data in SQL and created a dashboard using power bi.<br>

The Sakila database is a nicely normalized schema modeling a DVD rental store, featuring things like films, actors, film-actor relationships, and a central inventory table that connects films, stores, and rentals.

#### The flow of work:<br>
- Downloaded the database and installed Sakila Database into MySQL Workbench.<br>
- Analyzing data using queries in SQL. <br>
- Connect the data to the Powerbi desktop. <br>
- Transform data. <br>
- Creating data model: calculated more columns and measures in Power query by adding DAX measures (COUNTX, CONCATENATE, COUNTBLANK, DISTINCT COUNT, SWITCH, SWITCH(TRUE()), Format(), CALCULATE(COUNTA()), IF(), AVERAGE() ).<br>
- KPI <br>
- Building the dashboard: created various visualizations in Power Bl, including charts, graphs, heat maps, and others. The visualizations were created to be easily understood by stakeholders so they could make
data-driven decisions.<br>
- Added buttons and Navigation Pane, drill through & tooltip <br>
- Used custom visuals from the power bi marketplace<br>


#### Project findings:<br>
All the findings are documented in an Excel sheet. Among them, some of the major findings are:-<br>
1. People are renting fewer family films and more films those are for 13+
2. India has the largest number of customers SUSAN DAVIS has done height number of films Height amount of sales was in July
3. The sports category has made height amount of sales MIKE has handled more number of customers 42 of  the films are not in stocks
4. Most	films are in the sports category Customers rent more game-category film
5. Most films have on average 2 or 3 special features Most films are more than 90 min long
